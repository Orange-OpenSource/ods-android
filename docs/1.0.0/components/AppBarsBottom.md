## Accessibility

Please follow [accessibility criteria for development](https://a11y-guidelines.orange.com/en/mobile/android/development/).

Android's bottom app bar component APIs provide support for the navigation icon,
action items, overflow menu and more for informing the user as to what each
action performs. While optional, their use is strongly encouraged.

**Content descriptions**

When using icons for navigation icons, action items and other elements of bottom
app bars, you should set a content description on them so that screen readers
like TalkBack are able to announce their purpose or action, if any.
